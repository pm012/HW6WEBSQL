Task details: 

Implement a database whose schema contains:

     Table of students;
     Table of groups;
     Table of teachers;
     Table of subjects with the indication of the teacher who reads the subject;
     A table where each student has grades in subjects with an indication of when the grade was received;

Fill the resulting database with random data (~30-50 students, 3 groups, 5-8 subjects, 3-5 teachers, up to 20 grades for each student in all subjects).

Use the Faker pack to fill the database.

Make the following selections from the obtained database:

     1. Find the 5 students with the highest GPA(grate point average) across all subjects.
     2. Find the student with the highest GPA in a particular subject.
     3. Find the average score in groups for a certain subject.
     4. Find the average score on the stream (across the entire scoreboard grades table).
     5. Find what courses a particular teacher teaches.
     6. Find a list of students in a specific group.
     7. Find the grades of students in a separate group for a specific subject.
     8. Find the average score given by a certain teacher in his subjects.
     9. Find a list of courses a student is taking.
     10. A list of courses taught to a specific student by a specific instructor.

For each request, issue a separate query_number.sql file, where instead of number, substitute the number of the request. The file contains an SQL statement that can be executed both in the database terminal and via cursor.execute(sql)
